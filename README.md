🍜 Dublin 5400 Dinner Roulette

This is a simple React application designed to help you and your team decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Users can manage a list of restaurants, filter them based on categories like Dine-in, Takeout, and Fast Food, and start a simulated dice roll to randomly select a restaurant.

Special Feature: Restaurants can be tagged as Dine-in/Takeout (Mixed). This means the restaurant will be included in the selection list if either the "Dine-in" or the "Takeout" filter is checked.
